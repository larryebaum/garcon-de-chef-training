## Purpose
Creating machines for students to use in our [onsite Chef training](https://training.chef.io/training/onsite.html) takes manual effort. I don't like manual effort. This project reduces manual effort significantly.

This project does the following:
  - Creates machines for [onsite Chef training](https://training.chef.io/training/onsite.html)
  - Creates a Markdown file that assigns machines to students

## Prerequisites

This project depends on Hashicorp Terraform to create VMs in AWS. Ensure Terraform is installed by installing from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
## How To Use

1. Verify `~/.aws/credentials` is configured. (see [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html))
2. Copy `config.yml.example` to `config.yml`
3. Modify `config.yml`
    - Modify class type
    - Modify company name
    - Modify tag info (X-Dept, X-Contact)
    - Modify student list
3. Run `rake create`
4. Create a GitHub Gist from resulting Markdown in `output/` (I recommend using <https://github.com/defunkt/gist>)
5. Profit

## Cleanup

### Automatic
1. Run `rake destroy:force`

### Manual
2. Run `terraform destroy` in the terraform directory corresponding to your class (Example: `output/2017-04-06-Testing-chef-essentials-windows/terraform/`)

## Using Multiple AWS Accounts

Since this project uses Terraform you have the option to configure it to use an multiple AWS accounts. To do this you need to configure profiles in your `~/.aws/config`. A detailed guide on this process can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-multiple-profiles).

Please note, that should you have AWS Access & Secret Keys hardcoded as environment variables AWS will give these values precedence. You may wish to remove those entries and instead manage your AWS credentials as indicated below. 

TL;DR:
  1. Add a profile block to your `~/.aws/config`. Example:
  ```
  [default]
  region=us-west-2
  output=json

  [profile other-account]
  region=us-east-1
  output=json
  ```
  2. Add credentials for your profile to `~/.aws/credentials`. Example:
  ```
  [default]
  aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
  aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

  [other-account]
  aws_access_key_id=AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
  aws_secret_access_key=je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
  ```
  3. Modify profile value in your `config.yml`
  4. Follow other parts of the `How to Use` section above

## Testing

This project both conforms to RuboCop standards and has RSpec tests.

To run both use: `rake test`

To run just RSpec run: `rake test:unit`

To run just RuboCop run: `rake test:lint`
